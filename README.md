# Sixers
The code which I have submitted here uses solidity language which I have learned from metacrafters.
# Public variables
At the start of the code, I assigned a token name and abbreviation using the String variable.
# Mapping Variable 
This variable is used to display the balances that is if we add an address to it, it should show the balance amount of tokens. 
# Mint Function 
The mint function is used to add new tokens to the total supply. It has two parameters address and value.
# Burn function 
This function is used to remove the tokens from the total supply. Also, an if function is provided in order to avoid burning when tokens are more than the total supply.
